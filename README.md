#learning_450k
#overview
This will be written in the format of a blog style.
This will be a log of my progress in learning 450k analysis for my thesis.
I have picked up much of 450k analysis from random places. This will be a comprehensive analysis, where everything I know will be put here.
The first step is to learn github.

#adding files to github
git add $file
git commit -m "$message"
git remote add remote add origin "$github_account" #if origin master needs to be changed
git push -u origin master

#checking status of github
git status 
git log
git log --oneline
